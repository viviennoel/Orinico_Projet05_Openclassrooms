# Orinico_Projet05_Openclassrooms
Projet 05 de la formation développeur Web chez Openclassrooms

Prerequisites
You need to have Node and npm installed locally on your machine in order to start the server locally.

Installation
Clone this repository. From within the project folder, run npm install. You will then be able to run the server using node server. The server should run on localhost with default port 3000 (If another port is used, you will see it printed on the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001).

You can as well use http-server, a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

Documentation of http-server (installation and use) is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
